# SessionBuddy

SessionBuddy is a Java 'helper library' to make it very simple for a Java developer to consume the API at https://thesession.org.  More information about the API can be found at https://thesession.org/API.

SessionBuddy removes the need for the developer to: 
* build and format the URLs required to search for or access the desired data
* deal with parsing the JSON response into a usable structure

SessionBuddy uses Google's [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to parse the JSON data returned from the API into Java objects.  To use SessionBuddy, you will need to add Gson to your project's build path.

Note that the current project Wiki is out of date and relates to an older version of the library.  The Wiki will be updated over the coming weeks/months.
